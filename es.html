  <h1>Elementary Gifted and Talented Curriculum</h1>
</div>

<p class="post__paragraph--callout">Special curriculum and services are provided by one or more <a href="/academics/gifted-and-talented/resource-teachers/#elem">G/T Resource Teachers</a> in every elementary school. General education teachers also provide instruction to allow for accelerated learning in Language Arts and Mathematics.</p>

<h2>G/T Mathematics Program</h2>
<p>The 4th and 5th grade G/T Mathematics Program offers an enriched and accelerated mathematics curriculum taught daily in place of the general education mathematics curriculum. </p>

<p>Participation in the G/T Mathematics Program is based upon multiple criteria, including a variety of performance measures and the results from the administration of the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) to all students in Grade 3.</p>

<h2>Schoolwide Enrichment Program</h2>
<p>The Schoolwide Enrichment Program provides enrichment and extension opportunities that include the following components.</p>

<section class="contents">
<div class="col-left">
<h3>G/T Instructional Seminars</h3>
<p>Seminars provide enrichment opportunities for all students based upon their interests. Students develop a broad range of advanced-level skills in preparation for in-depth study and the creation of products in their areas of interest. G/T Resource Teachers provide advanced-level instruction in a variety of areas, including written, oral, and visual communication skills; critical and creative thinking skills; research skills; technology skills; and skills in visual and performing arts. Students showcase their learning and creative products developed during the seminar to the community. </p>

<p>Participation in G/T Instructional Seminars is based upon student interest. Please contact the school’s elementary G/T Resource Teacher to indicate interest and learn about specific offerings at the school.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-right">
<h3>G/T Curriculum Extension Units (CEUs)</h3>
<p>CEUs engage participating students in grades two through five in thematic units that extend the grade-level curriculum through advanced-level thinking, questioning, and research. While participating in these units, students receive instruction from the G/T Resource Teacher for approximately two hours a week in advanced-level writing, reading, communication, and research skills. Students develop an individual or group product to demonstrate their learning.</p>

<p>Participation in G/T Curriculum Extension Units is based upon students’ academic strengths as demonstrated on a variety of performance indicators including MAP, PARCC, and CogAT assessments; classroom achievement; and performance in the Talent Spotting Lesson conducted prior to the unit. Families of students demonstrating academic readiness for the Curriculum Extension Units receive notification from the G/T Resource Teacher. </p>

<h3>G/T Research Investigations</h3>

<p>G/T Research Investigations offer enrichment opportunities for students who demonstrate a sincere interest in a particular field and a willingness to pursue this interest at an advanced-level over an extended period of time. In their role as investigator, individual or small groups of students discover and document real world problems and create original solutions. The G/T Resource Teacher provides instruction on advanced-level skills, facilitates the gathering of resource materials, and provides opportunities for feedback from a professional. Investigations generally last through the school year. The amount of instructional time each week with the G/T Resource Teacher depends upon the complexity of the investigation and may involve additional work outside the classroom. </p>

<p>Participation in G/T Research Investigations is based upon student interest. Please contact the school’s elementary G/T Resource Teacher to learn more about this opportunity.</p>

  <p><strong>HCPSS Students Lead the Way for New Legislation</strong></p>
  <p>Following the work of HCPSS students, legislation was signed on October 10, 2018 to ban coal tar sealants in Howard County. The students began their activism at Centennial Lane Elementary School and continued it on at Burleigh Manor Middle School. <a href="https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2018/10/hcpss-students-lead-the-way-for-new-legislation/">Learn more about their G/T research investigation project &rarr;</a></p>
