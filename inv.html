<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What is the Gifted and Talented (G/T) Parent Advisory Committee?</h3>
<p class="hide">The G/T Parent Advisory Committee (GTAC) is a long-standing group of Howard County parents and community members who are interested in G/T programs offered by the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS). This committee works with the HCPSS G/T office, school administrators, G/T resource teachers, and other school personnel to receive updates, ask questions, and provide feedback related to G/T programs.</p>
<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Why are G/T Parent Representatives needed?</h3>
<p class="hide">As educational philosophies and policies change over time, advocates are needed who are committed to ensuring that school policies and programs benefit all students, including advanced-level learners. As parents, we can enhance the education of our children by being informed and providing feedback related to G/T programs.</p>
<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What is the primary role of the Parent Representative?</h3>
<p class="hide">The primary role of the Parent Representative is to be a liaison between the GTAC and the school community. Parent representatives can keep G/T teachers and fellow parents updated on information from meetings and provide feedback to the committee from their school communities. Representatives may also assist G/T resource teachers in other ways, as requested.</p>
<h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What other opportunities exist for me as a parent representative?</h3>
<p class="hide">There are additional opportunities to be involved in the GTAC. Representatives may serve on the Steering Committee of GTAC, advocate for the group at meetings of the Board of Education of Howard County, and represent the group at policy committee meetings. Parent representatives may also wish to research new and proposed laws and decisions, which may affect advanced-level learners. There are also opportunities to become an officer on the Steering Committee and to assist with the planning and implementation of events, such as the G/T Educator Recognition Event held in the Spring.</p>
