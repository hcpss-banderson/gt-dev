    <div class="hide hide--content">
      <p>The G/T Writers Guild is an extension of the seventh grade writing program offered in all county middle schools for selected students who participate in G/T English. It provides talented writers with the opportunity to produce authentic writing based on their individual interests and to have a clear understanding of the elements that constitute compelling writing. Participating students meet at least twice monthly and are expected to submit their writing for publication consideration.</p>

      <p>The G/T Education Program publishes a countywide literary and art magazine, Our Voice, annually to provide additional publication opportunities for students.</p>
    </div>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-2 fa-angle-right" style="color:#0063A4; font-weight:bold;"></i> History Day</h4>
    <div class="hide hide--content">  
      <p>National History Day (NHD) is a highly regarded academic organization for secondary school students. The History Day Extension is offered in most Howard County middle schools.</p>

      <p>Each year, more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands of teachers nationwide, participate in the NHD contest. Students choose historical topics related to a theme and conduct extensive primary and secondary research through libraries, archives, museums, oral history interviews, and historic sites. After analyzing and interpreting their sources and drawing conclusions about their topics’ significance in history, students present their work in original papers, exhibits, performances and documentaries. These products are entered into competitions in the spring at local, state and national levels where they are evaluated by professional historians and educators.</p>
    </div>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-2 fa-angle-right" style="color:#0063A4; font-weight:bold;"></i> Shakespeare Troupe/Festival</h4>
    <div class="hide hide--content">
      <p>The Shakespeare Troupe provides an opportunity for students to interpret Shakespeare’s works through a collaborative creative production. Students experience Shakespearean drama through a performance-based and language-centered approach as they develop a unique dramatic interpretation. Scripts may be shortened versions of a single Shakespearean play or a compilation of scenes from one or more of his works following a chosen theme. As students compile the script and develop their own dramatic interpretation, they strengthen their critical thinking, leadership, organization, and presentation skills.</p>

      <p>Students may perform their production in a variety of authentic venues, including the Howard County Shakespeare Festival.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research Class</h2>

<p>G/T Research is designed for sixth grade students who participate in G/T English and G/T Mathematics, based upon the recommendation of the G/T Placement Committee. Participating students receive instruction in advanced-level skills that they apply in their G/T classes. The research class provides a curricular framework for students to become producers of new knowledge as they apply research skills modeled in the curriculum to an original investigation in a self-selected area of study.</p>

<p>Students will learn how to conduct both primary and secondary research in an effort to address a particular topic and research question. As part of the secondary research process, students will learn how to select and define a topic, locate source material, record notes, and assemble a conclusion paper. While working through the primary research process, students will learn how to state a research question, state a hypothesis, determine the appropriate research design, collect data, analyze data, write a conclusion, and present their findings. See the <a href="/f/academics/gt/esscurrMS2013.pdf">G/T Research Class Essential Curriculum</a> <img alt="(PDF)" src="http://www.hcpss.org/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0"> for further details.</p>

<p><small>**All CogAT Percentiles and Composites Scores are Grade Percentile Rank (GPR).</small></p>

<p>Those students entering HCPSS in middle school will be tested using the School and College Ability Test (SCAT). </p>

<p>In addition to those students whose scores fall within the CogAT or SCAT eligibility ranges, students also may be recommended to participate in G/T content classes by the school’s G/T Placement Committee. This committee reviews multiple data points related to a student’s performance, including additional assessment scores, student work samples, Instructional Seminar and Curriculum Extension Unit participation, and report card grades. The committee may recommend placement at the end of elementary school or in subsequent middle school years.</p>

<p>If a student is not eligible for G/T content area classes through testing, parents, teachers, and administrators may request a placement review, a process which incorporates multiple criteria including standardized tests, student work samples, classroom observation, and parental and teacher input. For information on how parents may initiate the placement review process, please refer to <a href="/f/academics/gt/middle/Placement_parent_info.pdf">Parent Initiation of the Placement Review Process document </a><img alt="(PDF)" src="http://www.hcpss.org/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /> for G/T Content Area Classes.</p>

<p>If a family disagrees with the recommendation of the G/T Placement Committee, the family has the option to complete the Course Placement Review form, which would enroll the student in the requested class. Interested families should contact their child's school-based G/T Resource Teacher.</p>

<h2 id="enrich">Enrichment Opportunities</h2>

<h3>Middle School Expo</h3>
<p>Each year, under the direction of the G/T Resource Teacher, middle school students in Howard County Public Schools engage in academic pursuits that allow them to explore their intellectual curiosity. Providing an arena to spotlight these pursuits, the annual Middle School Achievement Expo offers the opportunity for student ambassadors to participate in a professional conference where they can interact with other learners to be inspired to use their voices for change.</p>

<p>The conference begins with a keynote speaker, and then students attend morning sessions where they listen to their peers describe their academic learning in their various fields of study. In the afternoon, ambassadors attend sessions presented by adult professionals who share their research methodologies to inspire the students’ scholarship. The conference closes with the opportunity for students to synthesize their experience and complete a Declaration of Intention, stating how they will use their voices for change in the upcoming school year.</p>

<h3>Instructional Seminars</h3>

<div class="col-left">
<p>G/T Instructional Seminars are designed to extend student interests beyond general exploratory experiences. Students develop a broad range of advanced-level skills in preparation for in-depth study and creation of a product on a chosen interest.</p>
<p>G/T Resource Teachers provide advanced-level instruction and schedule these opportunities for interested students. Skill development might include written, oral, and visual communication skills, critical and creative thinking skills, research skills, technology skills, and skills in visual and performing arts.</p>
<p>Television Production, Middle School Book Club, and the Debate seminars are offered in each of the school system&#8217;s middle schools. Additional seminars are offered, such as journalism, environmental studies, robotics, creative problem solving, film production, and leadership, based upon the interests of the students at the school.

  <div id="list">
    <h4><i class="fa fa-2 fa-angle-right" style="color:#0063A4; font-weight:bold;"></i> Television Production</h4>
    <div class="hide hide--content">
     <p>As members of the television production team, students create a daily, live television broadcast utilizing highly-developed skills in journalism and technology.</p>

     <p>Scriptwriters employ advanced journalism and research skills in the selection and development of newsworthy pieces. Anchors emulate professional public speakers as they develop skills in clarity, enunciation, poise, eye contact, and vocal expression. Crew members utilize technology, such as cameras, mixers, sound boards, and computers, to maximize the effectiveness of the broadcast for a student audience. Producers and directors demonstrate leadership skills in the management of the team and the assessment of its needs. To ensure the highest quality production, the television production team incorporates feedback gathered via primary research.</p>
    </div>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-2 fa-angle-right" style="color:#0063A4; font-weight:bold;"></i> Middle School Book Club</h4>
    <div class="hide hide--content">  
     <p>The Middle School Book Club, organized and led by advanced-level readers, is an intellectual collaboration where passionate readers engage in meaningful discussions of a literary work, strengthen critical reading and leadership skills, hear insightful peer perspectives, and have fun.</p>

     <p>The Middle School Book Club is actually composed of two related activities: 1) The school-based Middle School Book Club and 2) the countywide Middle School Book Club. The school-based Book Club is organized by the G/T Resource Teacher and is open to avid readers in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Each middle school reads the same literary selection each month. The G/T Resource Teacher arranges at least one meeting of the Book Club’s members each month to discuss the selection.</p>

     <p>The countywide Book Club meetings take place once a month at the Miller Branch Library in Ellicott City. Two to three representatives from each school-based Middle School Book Club attend the meetings for high-level, in-depth discussions. Each month, one or two middle schools are responsible for leading the discussion of that month’s selection.</p>
    </div>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-2 fa-angle-right" style="color:#0063A4; font-weight:bold;"></i> Debate</h4>
    <div class="hide hide--content">
      <p>The Debate Instructional Seminar motivates a group of students to engage in meaningful, persuasive discourse about contemporary issues, thereby strengthening their leadership, critical thinking, and presentation skills. Students use research skills to develop logical arguments supported with evidence to be applied to debates following a prescribed format. Debate skills have many cross-curricular applications and extend many curricular objectives.</p>

      <p>The Seminar prepares participating students for high school, and potentially collegiate, Debate Teams in later years.</p>

<h3>Research Investigations</h3>
<p>G/T Research Investigations offer the highest level of enrichment for students who demonstrate a sincere interest in a particular field and a willingness to pursue this interest at an advanced-level over an extended period of time. In their roles as investigators, individuals or small groups of students discover and document real-world problems, create original solutions, and seek to fill gaps in the knowledge within a field of study. Students apply their knowledge of advanced-level content in their pursuit of the investigative process. This process includes formulating a problem, using the research tools and methodologies of a professional, and presenting the results to an authentic audience.</p>

<p>The G/T Resource Teacher provides instruction on advanced-level skills, facilitates the gathering of resource materials, and provides opportunities for feedback from professionals. Investigations generally last throughout the school year. The amount of instructional time each week with the G/T Resource Teacher depends upon the complexity of the investigation and involves additional work outside the classroom.</p>

<p>Parents can expect regular progress reports throughout the investigation and a formal evaluation at the conclusion of the investigation. All research investigations are displayed for community viewing at the school enrichment fairs in the spring.</p>
