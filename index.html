  <li>Provide differentiated instruction and curriculum to continuously improve student achievement and performance.</li>
  <li>Provide for the social and emotional needs of advanced-level learners.</li>
  <li>Recognize and develop diverse abilities and talents.</li>
  <li>Provide comprehensive professional learning for its teachers to help them meet the unique needs of advanced-level students.</li>

  <h2>Definitions of Giftedness</h2>
<p>The G/T Program is based upon two definitions of giftedness which serve as a foundation for talent development in the program and selection of students. HCPSS subscribes to multi-dimensional definitions of giftedness, seeking to recognize and develop talents in students.</p>

<div class="col-left">
<h3>Talent Development</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits; above average ability, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity. Students demonstrating gifted behaviors are those possessing or capable of developing this composite set of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of human performance."</p>
<cite>Adapted from Joseph Renzulliâ€™s definition.</cite>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="col-right">
<h3>Academic Coursework</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced-level learners are those "having outstanding talent and performing, or showing the potential for performing, at remarkably high levels of accomplishment when compared with other students of a similar age, experience, or environment."</p>
<cite>Annotated Code of Maryland, 8-201</cite>
